## Intelligent Vehicle ROS Project 🚗🤖
✅ Real-time SLAM mapping & localization
✅ Global / Local path planning
✅ YOLO-based object detection
✅ Speech interaction (ASR + TTS)
✅ Autonomous navigation with obstacle avoidance

## Introduction
This project is developed based on the **ROS (Robot Operating System)** framework for the **National College Student Intelligent Vehicle Competition**.  
By integrating multiple sensors including **LiDAR, RGB camera, IMU, and microphone array**, the system achieves:

- **SLAM Mapping & Localization**: Real-time map building with AMCL and EKF for improved accuracy.  
- **Path Planning & Navigation**: Supports global planning (Dijkstra / A*) and local planning (DWA / TEB) with obstacle avoidance.  
- **Object Detection**: YOLO-based deep learning model for human detection and recognition.  
- **Speech Recognition & Synthesis**: RNN/Deep Neural Network for voice command recognition and TTS for voice output.  
- **Motion Control**: Controller manager for wheel velocity and steering control.  

This framework can be applied to **autonomous cars, indoor mobile robots, and service robots**.

## Environment Setup

### 1. System Requirements
- Ubuntu 18.04  
- ROS Melodic  
- CUDA / cuDNN (optional, for deep learning acceleration)  

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-desktop-full
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-navigation ros-melodic-slam-gmapping
sudo apt-get install python-rosdep python-rosinstall

### 3. Initialize Workspace
```bash
cd ~/Smart_car/
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash

Usage
1. Launch SLAM Mapping
```bash
roslaunch ucar_nav slam_gmapping.launch
➡️ Drive the vehicle to collect LiDAR data and generate the environment map.

2. Localization & Navigation
```bash
roslaunch ucar_nav navigation.launch
➡️ Set a goal in RViz, and the vehicle will plan and follow the path automatically.

3. Speech Recognition & TTS
```bash
rosrun speech_recognition asr_node.py
rosrun speech_recognition tts_node.py
➡️ Enable voice command recognition and voice broadcast.

4. Object Detection (YOLO)
```bash
roslaunch vision_yolo yolo_detect.launch
➡️ Detect human targets on the track and trigger corresponding actions.
